# escape-from-woods
Assignment
Read the map file from the resources folder and count the least number of steps needed to get out of the forest.
Game rules
• Find the fastest way out from the forest and return steps count as an answer (output)
• At the starting position (at the symbol “X”), your steps count is 0
• You can only move through the empty spaces (symbol “ ”)
• If the file is corrupted or there is no exit – return 0
Map Characteristics
• The map is a rectangular shape
• Axissize:5<=X<=11000,5<=Y<=11000
• Map consists of symbols “ ”, “1”, “X”:
o “ ” – empty spaces where you can move o “1” – forest/trees
o “X” – your start position
• There could be from 0 to 1000 exits
To achieve better results, you have several map files that you can test.
Other Requirements
• Keep the code clean and use the best coding practices
• Write unit tests for the solution
• The submitted solution should not be printing anything to the console
• You cannot make any changes in the Game.java file
